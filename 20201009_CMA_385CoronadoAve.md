## Analysis ##
<br>
<br>

Of the six properties that sold nearby, nearly all matched the physical dimensions of 385 Coronado Ave:

- All but one were du/triplex.
- All had 5 bedrooms except for 2 with 4 bedrooms.
- The mean living square feet were 2,334 with the mean lot size of 6,607.
  - The mean price per living square foot was $510
  
The duplex at 385 Coronado Ave has nearly the same living square footage and a larger lot size that the comparison homes at 6,751 square feet. At the current list price, the much lower $487/square feet of living space for 385 Coronado Ave is impressive.

Furthermore:

- The mean sale price was $1,176,000 with a mean Redfin Estimate of $1,299,986
  - The mean sale price came in at 9.5% under the Redfin Estimate

Assuming this stays stable, we can estimate that the sale price of 385 Coronado Ave will come in at approxiamtely $1,088,819, very near its current list price of $1,087,800.

The current bid of $1,010,000, stands at 92.8% of 385 Coronado Ave's list price. Even if that initial offer isn't successful, any reduction in the sale price from the list price will have beat the mean sell-to-Redfin-Estimate pricepoint.
